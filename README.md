Check Client Details Hook for WHMCS (MIT License)
Version 1.0 by KuJoe (JMD.cc)
	
//Requirements:
NONE

//Installation:
1) Upload the chkclientdetails.php file into your WHMCS's hooks directory (/includes/hooks/).

//Optional:
A) Edit $fields to add or remove fields to check (by default all fields with type "string" that are supported in the current WHMCS release are included).
B) Edit $blocked to add or remove words that are blocked (by default I've included a few words that seem to be the most common for automated SQL Injections).
C) Edit text in $errormessage and $error to fit your language or preference.

Example of what the client sees with blocked values:
![Alt text](/example.png?raw=true "Example")
